# CS210
My First Repository for CS210

1. Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  This project is able to read an input file, like a grocery list, and utilize that file to tell how many occurrences that object has in the file.

2. What did you do particularly well?
   I think the implementation of the menu is pretty decent and it looks relatively good.
   
3. Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
   I need to practice doing more of the code outside of the main function. I've been successful in the past but I need to ensure that I remain consistent with my code.
   
4. Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
   The optional input validation really bit me near the end. I had it working but after putting a combination of an incorrect followed by a correct input, the program would execute an infinite loop. Then I had to figure
   out how to clear the input and terminate the loop if the input was wrong.
   
5. What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
   The input validation that I learned from this project will be most beneficial in the future and will most likely make input validation second nature to me now.
   
6. How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
   With the use of functions and classes, it prevented a lot of hard code in the program. Being able to update the functions once makes the program very maintainable and adaptable. Finally, the function also assists in the
   readability so that the reader will see the name or title of the function and should know what needs to happen from that section of code.
